## Introduction

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) targeted at embedded systems and microcontroller development can come with a lot of overhead.  They have a tendency to be bulky, unwieldy programs that can take up a lot of hard drive space, and when something isn't configured properly they can be a pain to troubleshoot.  No one likes digging into project settings for hours trying to get their include paths working, troubleshooting five different configuration options just to link a library, or tracking a bug back down to project config option.

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a lightweight, powerful, and customizable editor that can serve as a great free alternative to the more traditional micro IDEs like Eclipse, Code-Composer Studio, IAR, Keil uVision, etc.  This app note outlines step-by-step how to get started with [VSCode-Maxim](https://github.com/MaximIntegratedTechSupport/VSCode-Maxim), which is a collection of project configurations that integrate Maxim's Microcontrollers SDK into Visual Studio Code.

## De-Mystifying the SDK Toolchain

Maxim maintains a Software Development Kits (SDK) for microcontroller development called the "Maxim Micros SDK".  The SDK contains a large number of components, such as register files, linker files, board-support packages (BSPs), peripheral drivers, example code, etc.  This section will focus on one of the _core_ components of the SDK - the _toolchain_.

Understanding the toolchain is important because this VSCode-Maxim project is essentially a "wrapper" around the toolchain.  Let's take a look under the hood...

A [toolchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toolchain) is really just a collection of programs and typically includes compiler, linker, and debugger executables.  It also may include utility programs and build systems to make using these lower-level programs more convenient.

The main components of the SDK's Toolchain are:

* [Arm GNU Compiler Collection](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm) (GCC) - located under `~/MaximSDK/Tools/GNUTools/10.3`
* [Open On-Chip Debugger](http://openocd.org/) (OpenOCD) - located under `~/MaximSDK/Tools/OpenOCD`
* [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make) - made available on Windows via [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) and located under `~/MaximSDK/Tools/MSYS2/usr/bin`

GCC is used to compile source code but is rarely called directly.  Instead, GCC is most frequently invoked in a list of directives collected into a _Makefile_.  This list of directives is called a _recipe_.  If you are new to Make, think of GCC as the hammer and Make as the builder who knows how to use it.  You can tell Make to do a task (such as "make all" the source code) and Make will follow the instructions outlined in the Makefile's recipe to complete it.

Detailed documentation on the Makefile system can be found [here](https://github.com/Analog-Devices-MSDK/VSCode-Maxim/tree/develop#build-configuration).  The important thing to note now is that every example project comes with a Makefile and project.mk file that manages GCC.  They offer convenient configuration variables if needed and manage the source code for the project.

Great - so source code is compiled into firmware binaries by Make using GCC.  How is it flashed onto the microcontroller?  That's where OpenOCD comes in.  

OpenOCD handles flashing firmware and opening a debugger _server_.  It handles the necessary configuration to support the variety of debugger adapters and debugger protocols (such as SWD or JTAG) that are available and sends debugging information and instructions to the microcontroller.  OpenOCD deals with the low-level hardware and exposes a common high-level interface that can be used with a debugger _client_ such as GDB.  GDB connects to the OpenOCD server over a socket and presents a user interface.

In general, this is how things work at a low level.  Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) such as Visual Studio Code have mechanisms for integrating toolchains so that these low-level steps can be abstracted away in a more convenient way.

## Integrating the Toolchain

Visual Studio Code provides the [Tasks](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/editor/tasks) interface for integrating external tools.  To use the Maxim SDK toolchain via Tasks, the toolchain binaries must be made accessible from the command line.  Additionally, the correct board and peripheral driver files for a target platform must be loaded for compilation and source code development.  When those conditions are met, then Tasks can be created to conveniently implement the features that you would expect from an IDE:  building, cleaning, flashing, etc.

[VSCode-Maxim](https://github.com/MaximIntegratedTechSupport/VSCode-Maxim) handles this for you and offers project files that are configured for Maxim's SDK and toolchain.

Let's get started setting it up and walking through some common use-cases.  The procedure below is a demonstration for the MAX32670EVKIT running on Windows 10, but the same procedure applies to all micros and OS's.

## Getting Started with VSCode-Maxim

### 1 - Install Software Requirements

First, follow the [installation instructions](https://github.com/MaximIntegratedTechSupport/VSCode-Maxim#installation) for your OS from the readme if you haven't already.  This include installing software requirements and setting the `MAXIM_PATH` environment variable.

---

### 2 - Release Package Overview

The VSCode-Maxim release package should contain the following contents.  Note: Releases between OS's/versions may differ _slightly_ from the screenshot below, but this should match in general...

![Release Contents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaximIntegratedTechSupport/VSCode-Maxim/main/img/Release-contents.jpg)

* `"Inject"` contains _just_ the VSCode-Maxim config files _without_ any source code.  It's contents are designed to be used to "inject" a VSCode-Maxim project into any folder.
* `"MaximSDK"` is used during the installation process.  Its contents can be copied into the root directory of an SDK installation to populate the SDK's example projects with VSCode-Maxim project files.
* `"New_Project"` is a starter template project with a little bit of source code.  This folder is available to make creating new VSCode-Maxim projects easier.  Copy it over to a new location and rename it to create a new starter project.
* `"LICENSE.md"` contains Maxim's copyright notice.
* `"readme.md"` is the core readme file for the project, and you should read it!
* `"userguide.md"` is this User Guide.

### 3 - Starter Project

In this section, we'll get hands on with the VSCode-Maxim starter project to see how it works.

First, copy the "New_Project" folder from the VSCode-Maxim release package into an accessible location.  You can also rename the folder if you'd like.  For example, I've copied the folder to a `workspace` directory I created in my User folder below.  I've also renamed the project to "MyProject".

**It's important that the folder name and location does _not_ contain any spaces** - this will break the project files.

![MyProject](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaximIntegratedTechSupport/VSCode-Maxim/main/img/myproject_location.jpg)

Now, launch Visual Studio Code.  On startup, it should look something like this:

![VSCode Startup Screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaximIntegratedTechSupport/VSCode-Maxim/main/img/VSCode-startup.jpg)

Select `Open Folder...` on the welcome page, or alternatively get there with `File -> Open Folder...`

"Open folder" is the main mechanism for opening projects in VS Code.  For those familiar with IDEs that offer options such as "New Project" or "Open Project", this may seem counterintuitive.  However, this will start to make more sense as you use it.  VS Code's editor is based entirely out of its working directory, and a `.vscode` folder inside that working directory can contain local settings overrides.  This is similar to the way `.git` folders work.

![File Open Folder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaximIntegratedTechSupport/VSCode-Maxim/main/img/file_openfolder.JPG)


So...  After `File > Open Folder` navigate _inside_ of template project created earlier and click "Select Folder".

![Browse](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaximIntegratedTechSupport/VSCode-Maxim/main/img/myproject_openfolder.jpg)

VS Code will prompt for trust the first time.  Select _Trust folder and enable all features_.

![Trust Prompt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaximIntegratedTechSupport/VSCode-Maxim/main/img/workspaceTrustPrompt.JPG)

Now, VS Code should look something like this, where the template project has been opened in the file explorer.

![File opened](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaximIntegratedTechSupport/VSCode-Maxim/main/img/myproject_opened.jpg)

---

### 4 - Verify Toolchain Access

At this point, the project is opened and ready to use and configure.  Let's take a few steps on the integrated terminal to verify that things _are_ actually working correctly.

First, launch a terminal with `Terminal > New Terminal`.

![New Terminal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaximIntegratedTechSupport/VSCode-Maxim/main/img/myproject_terminal.jpg)

Next, we'll run through the commands in the ["Testing the Setup"](https://github.com/Analog-Devices-MSDK/VSCode-Maxim/wiki/Troubleshooting#testing-the-setup) of the wiki to see that the toolchain is accessible.  This is critical for everything else to work.  The project settings in the `.vscode` folder will add the locations of the toolchain to the terminal's `PATH`, which will allow them to be accessed directly.

For example, running `make -v` in the terminal should output a version # for Make, as shown below.

![Make Test](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaximIntegratedTechSupport/VSCode-Maxim/main/img/make_test.JPG)

Run the other commands for OpenOCD, GCC, and GDB to verify that the integrated terminal has been configured correctly and the toolchain is in the right place.  These should all run without error.

* `openocd -v`
* `arm-none-eabi-gcc -v`
* `arm-none-eabi-gdb -v`

If there _are_ any errors thrown by any of the commands above, first verify that you've followed the [installation instructions](https://github.com/MaximIntegratedTechSupport/VSCode-Maxim#installation) correctly.  Problems are usually related to a missing or incorrect `MAXIM_PATH` environment variable and/or missing SDK components.  Otherwise, see the [troubleshooting section](https://github.com/Analog-Devices-MSDK/VSCode-Maxim/wiki/Troubleshooting) of the wiki.

---

### 4 - Set the Target Platform

With the tools verified as accessible from within VS Code, we can now start to configure the project for a specific microcontroller.

In this case, we'll do some basic configuration of the project for the MAX32670EVKIT, but the same steps apply to any micro.

Open `.vscode/settings.json`.  This is the main configuration file, and you shouldn't need to interact with any of the other files inside of the `.vscode` folder except for in the most advanced use-cases.

![Opening settings.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaximIntegratedTechSupport/VSCode-Maxim/main/img/settings.JPG)

Set the `"target"` and `"board"` variables for your target platform.
For example, for the MAX32670EVKIT I would set...

* `"target":"MAX32670"`
* `"board":"EvKit_V1"`

The [Project Configuration](https://github.com/Analog-Devices-MSDK/VSCode-Maxim/tree/develop#project-configuration) section of the readme will tell you the values that can be set here.  In this case, we've changed the two most basic options:  `"target"` and `"board"`.

![Basic Config Options](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaximIntegratedTechSupport/VSCode-Maxim/main/img/readme_basicconfig.jpg)

As shown in the readme, the value for the `"board"` option can vary.  This option sets the Board Support Package (BSP) to use, and it should match the name of a BSP folder for the target microcontroller.  BSPs for each microcontroller can be found in the `Libraries/Boards` folder of the SDK.

Save your changes to this file with `CTRL+S`.

Next, reload the VS Code window.  A reload is necessary after changing any options in `settings.json` to force a re-parse. The VS Code window can be conveniently re-loaded with the `Ctrl + Shift + P` -> `Reload Window` developer command.

![Reload window](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaximIntegratedTechSupport/VSCode-Maxim/main/img/reload_window.JPG)

Now VS Code is ready to edit, build, and debug source code for the target platform.

---

### 5 - Opening main.c

Open `main.c`, which can be found in the `src` folder.  Here we can see the source code for a simple "Hello world" program.

![main.c](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaximIntegratedTechSupport/VSCode-Maxim/main/img/main.JPG)

---

### 6 - Clean the Program

First, let's ensure that we're starting from a clean slate.  Open the build tasks menu with `Ctrl+Shift+B` or `Terminal > Run Build Task...` and select the "clean-periph" option.  This cleans out the build products from the current project as well as the peripheral drivers in the SDK.  With everything cleaned out, the next step will build everything from scratch.

![Cleaning the program](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaximIntegratedTechSupport/VSCode-Maxim/main/img/clean-periph.jpg)

Selecting the `clean-periph` build task will launch the task in the integrated terminal, and it will look someting like this...

![Clean-periph Complete](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaximIntegratedTechSupport/VSCode-Maxim/main/img/clean-periph_complete.jpg)

---

### 7 - Build the Program

Next, we'll build the source code.

Open the build tasks menu again with `Ctrl+Shift+B` or `Terminal > Run Build Task...`

![Build Tasks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaximIntegratedTechSupport/VSCode-Maxim/main/img/buildtasks_build.jpg)

Select `build` to compile the source code.  You'll notice the build task completing in the terminal window, and a new `build` directory will appear in the file explorer.  At the end of a successful build the program binary (.elf file) will be placed in this build directory.

![Build complete](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaximIntegratedTechSupport/VSCode-Maxim/main/img/build_complete.JPG)

So what happened here?

When we ran the "build" task, VS Code parsed the configuration options from `settings.json` into a `make all` command that you can see on the first line of the terminal (`Executing task: ...`).  When this command is run, Make looks inside of the project `Makefile` for the "all" recipe that tells it how to build the source code.  Remember the core GCC Makefile discussed earlier?  That's where the "all" recipe is defined.  You can open the project Makefile and see exactly where it's imported with `include`.

![Include core Makefile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaximIntegratedTechSupport/VSCode-Maxim/main/img/include_core_makefile.JPG)

The source code and compiler options are passed into the build with the variables further up in the Makefile...

![Makefile main options](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaximIntegratedTechSupport/VSCode-Maxim/main/img/Makefile_options.JPG)

This is a good time to (once again) re-iterate an important point:  _All configuration of the build itself must be done via the project's Makefile._  [Editing the Makefile](https://github.com/MaximIntegratedTechSupport/VSCode-Maxim/blob/main/readme.md#editing-the-makefile) in the readme covers this subject in more detail.

For now, take note of the fact that the example project comes  pre-configured for a single `main.c` source file, and looks for all `.c` and `.h` files inside of the `src` directory.

---

### 8 - Flash and Debug the Program

Now that we've seen the program build successfully, let's flash it onto the microcontroller and debug it.

First, ensure that your microcontroller is powered on and connected to your PC through your debug adapter.  The specifics of this will vary based on the platform you're using, but documentation can be found in the datasheet.  On a platform with an integrated debugger, such as the [MAX32670EVKIT](https://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/MAX32670EVKIT.pdf), this is as simple as plugging it in with a micro-usb cable.  On platforms where the debug adapter is not integrated, you'll need to connect your debug adapter to the right debugger port and power the platform separately.

With the debugger connected, flash the compiled program on to the microcontroller.  This is done with the `flash` build task.  Use `CTRL + SHIFT + B` to open up the build tasks menu again and select `flash`.  The `flash` build task will automatically run the `build` task first to make sure our program has actually been compiled successfully.  `build` is incremental, so the check should only take a few seconds since we've already built the code.  Then, the task will open an OpenOCD connection and flash the program binaries from a GDB client script.  The terminal output during `flash` will show the GDB side of the procedure, and a `flash.log` file will be created to log the OpenOCD side.  These can be viewed in case of any issues.  A successful flash should look something like below.

![Flash Task Complete](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaximIntegratedTechSupport/VSCode-Maxim/main/img/myproject_flash.jpg)

Once the flash is complete, launch the debugger by pressing `F5` or by navigating to the debugger window and pressing the green play button next to "GDB".

![Debugger Window](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaximIntegratedTechSupport/VSCode-Maxim/main/img/debugger_window.JPG)

Once the debugger connects it will break the program execution on entry into the `main` function.  VS Code should look something like this:

![Breakpoint Hit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaximIntegratedTechSupport/VSCode-Maxim/main/img/breakpoint_hit.JPG)

---

### 9 (optional) - Open a Serial Port to the Micro

Before we continue the program execution, you can optionally open up a serial port to the microcontroller to see the "Hello world!" message and count printed.

Default serial communication settings are:

* BAUD : 115200
* Data : 8-bit
* Parity : none
* Stop bits : 1 bit
* Flow control : none

[TeraTerm](https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en) and [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/) are good serial terminal program options.  To open a serial port to the microcontroller with one of these programs you'll first need to find the COM port associated with the debugger.  On Windows, this will show up as a generic USB Serial Device:

![COM port](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaximIntegratedTechSupport/VSCode-Maxim/main/img/78000_COM_port.JPG)

From there, steps will be program-specific to the serial terminal you're using.  For example, using TeraTerm I can navigate to `Setup -> Serial port...` to enter the communication settings above and open the connection.

![TeraTerm](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaximIntegratedTechSupport/VSCode-Maxim/main/img/TeraTerm.JPG)

---

### 10 - Continue the Program

Press `F5` or hit the continue button in the debugger menu to continue the program past the breakpoint.

![Continue button](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaximIntegratedTechSupport/VSCode-Maxim/main/img/continue_button.JPG)

You should see the LED on your microcontroller blinking.  If you have a terminal window open you should also see the "Hello World" message and count being printed.

![Hello World Terminal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaximIntegratedTechSupport/VSCode-Maxim/main/img/helloworld_terminal.JPG)

Feel free to play around in the debugger here (setting different breakpoints, watch variables, stepping into and out of functions, etc.) to get familiar.  When you're ready, you can hit the stop button to quit debugging.

---

### 11 - Wrapping Up

Here, we've gotten started with a basic project configuration, the available build tasks, and have flashed/debugged the template Hello World program.  

The `New_Project` project template is designed as a good re-usable starting point, and you can freely copy this project around and re-configure it for different target platforms.

You should now have a good basic understanding of how VS Code works and how Maxim's toolchain is integrated.  The next sections cover more advanced subjects.

---

## Referencing Example Code

Frequently, you might want to reference example code to see how to use the MaximSDK's peripheral drivers (I2C, GPIOs, ADCs, etc.)

In the MaximSDK examples can be found under the `~/MaximSDK/Examples/<Target Platform>` folder.  For instance, the MAX32670 has the following examples available:

![Examples folder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaximIntegratedTechSupport/VSCode-Maxim/main/img/examples_folder.JPG)

Opening the GPIO example reveals the following contents:

![GPIO Contents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaximIntegratedTechSupport/VSCode-Maxim/main/img/gpio_contents.JPG)

There are a couple components inside the project:

* A `main.c` file with the example code
* A project `Makefile` for building the example code
* Eclipse configuration files and debugger profile (`.cproject`, `.project`, `GPIO.launch`)
* A readme

A quick way to reference the example code is to drag and drop it into VS Code's editor while you have an active project open.  Settings from the active project will be used even when editing external files.  For example, having the template project opened in VS Code allows the `main.c` file from the GPIO example to be dragged into the editor with working function look-ups.

![GPIO Copy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaximIntegratedTechSupport/VSCode-Maxim/main/img/GPIO_copy.JPG)

![GPIO Imported](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaximIntegratedTechSupport/VSCode-Maxim/main/img/gpio_imported.JPG)

This provides a convenient way to reference the example code for your own application, and since Intellisense look-ups are loaded from our currently active project go-to definitions are supported.  For example, we can open the header file for the GPIO driver itself...

(Right click on `"gpio.h"` -> Go to Definition)

![GPIO Goto](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaximIntegratedTechSupport/VSCode-Maxim/main/img/gpio_goto.JPG)

... and see that the correct header file from the peripheral drivers is opened.

![GPIO Header](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaximIntegratedTechSupport/VSCode-Maxim/main/img/gpio_header.JPG)

If you want to dig in deeper and see how the peripheral driver functions are implemented at the register level, you can do so as well.  For example, we can look at the implementation of the `MXC_GPIO_Init` function.

![GPIO Init](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaximIntegratedTechSupport/VSCode-Maxim/main/img/gpio_init_rightclick.JPG)

The implementation file for the correct die-type of the microcontroller needs to be selected (in the case of the MAX32670 that's the ME21), and then the function definition can be viewed.  Double click on the function definition to open the full file view.

![GPIO Implementation File](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaximIntegratedTechSupport/VSCode-Maxim/main/img/gpio_init_implementation.JPG)

Using this method, you can quickly and easily reference example code for your own applications.  This method works for any external code, provided that the search paths for Intellisense are configured properly.  For more details on configuration of those search paths, see the [readme](https://github.com/MaximIntegratedTechSupport/VSCode-Maxim/blob/main/readme.md).

Note:  It's recommended to only use this method for _browsing/referencing_ example code.  If you'd like to work with the example projects directly, it's recommended to copy them to an external location to keep the SDK's reference copy untouched.  See the next section for more details.

## Loading Example Projects

Following the [installation procedure](https://github.com/MaximIntegratedTechSupport/VSCode-Maxim#installation) from the VSCode-Maxim readme will populate the MaximSDK's example projects with `.vscode` project folders.  As such, they're ready to use "out of the box" with `File -> Open Folder`.

However, it's recommended to copy the example projects to a location _outside_ of the SDK before using them.  Keeping a copy of the original examples intact and untouched is always a good idea in case you need to go back and reference them later.

By default, the example projects are configured for the "EVKIT" evaluation platform for each target microcontroller.  See [Project Settings](https://github.com/MaximIntegratedTechSupport/VSCode-Maxim#project-settings) in the readme if you need to change this. 

## Injecting into Existing Source Code

Using example code as a reference is great, but what if we want to inject the VS Code setup into an existing project that's not in the MaximSDK?  That's where the `Inject` folder in the VSCode-Maxim release package comes in.  

In the example below, we'll use the GPIO example _without_ any pre-existing VS Code project settings.  The same procedure applies to any existing source code.

### 1 - Locate the Existing Project

For the sake of this example, a working copy of the GPIO example has been copied over into a separate folder.

The contents of this GPIO example are as follows:

![GPIO Contents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaximIntegratedTechSupport/VSCode-Maxim/main/img/gpio_contents.JPG)

---

### 2 - Inject the VSCode-Maxim Files

Copy the _contents_ of the `Inject` folder from the VSCode-Maxim release package into the example project.

![GPIO Inject](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaximIntegratedTechSupport/VSCode-Maxim/main/img/inject_gpio.JPG)

The contents of the project should now look something like this, with our `.vscode` folder and new `Makefile`.

![GPIO Injected](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaximIntegratedTechSupport/VSCode-Maxim/main/img/inject_gpio_finished.JPG)

---

### 3 - Open the Project

The GPIO is now ready to be opened from within VS Code, and from here we'll follow a similar process as the one outlined in the "Getting Started" section of this User Guide.  You'll open the project folder and configure `settings.json` for your target platform.  However, since we're injecting into existing source code, we'll need to configure the Makefile as well.  First things first...

Launch VS Code.  Open the project folder with `File > Open Folder...` and browse to the root directory of the project.

![GPIO Root](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaximIntegratedTechSupport/VSCode-Maxim/main/img/gpio_root.JPG)

VS Code should prompt for workspace trust.  Select _Trust folder and enable all features_.

![Workspace Trust Prompt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaximIntegratedTechSupport/VSCode-Maxim/main/img/workspaceTrustPrompt.JPG)

---

### 4 - Set the Target Platform & Reload

Open `settings.json` inside of the `.vscode` folder and configure the project settings for your target platform.  See the [readme](https://github.com/MaximIntegratedTechSupport/VSCode-Maxim/blob/main/readme.md) if you are unsure what to set here.  
For example, settings for the MAX32670EVKIT would be...

* `"target":"MAX32670"`
* `"board":"EvKit_V1"`

The rest of the settings should be suitable for most use-cases.  The only other setting that might need a deeper look here is the `M4_OCD_interface_file`.  The default `cmsis-dap.cfg` setting is suitable for use with a target platform that MAX32625PICO debugger.  If your target platform has an integrated debugger (such as the MAX32670EVKIT), that's it.  Additionally, most evaluation kits will usually come with an _external_ MAX32625PICO debugger, so this setting can be left at its default.  In other cases, see [Advanced Config Options](https://github.com/MaximIntegratedTechSupport/VSCode-Maxim#advanced-config-options) in the readme.

![Reload Window](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaximIntegratedTechSupport/VSCode-Maxim/main/img/settings.JPG)

`CTRL+S` to save the changes to the file, and then reload the VS Code window with `CTRL + SHIFT + P` > `Developer: Reload Window`.  This is necessary so that VS Code re-parses all file-paths for our new target platform.

---

### 5 - Configure the Build System

By default, the build system will look in the root directory of the project for source (.c) and header (.h) files.  It will also search in the optional "src" (.c) and "include" (.h) directories.  If the project follows a non-standard structure with additional folders and files, they will need to be added to the build using the `IPATH` and `VPATH` [Build Configuration](https://github.com/Analog-Devices-MSDK/VSCode-Maxim/tree/develop#build-configuration) Variables.

### 6 - Clean & Build the GPIO Example

As always, with a new project it's best to run a `clean-periph` first to ensure we're starting from scratch.

Then, run a `build` task to compile the GPIO example.  Remember - build tasks can be accessed via `Terminal > Run Build Task...` or `Ctrl+Shift+B`.

![Build Tasks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaximIntegratedTechSupport/VSCode-Maxim/main/img/buildtasks.JPG)

Monitor the terminal for any errors as the Makefile builds the periphal drivers and the GPIO example source code.  A successful build will look something like this, ultimately linking everything into our final `.elf` file...

![GPIO Build](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaximIntegratedTechSupport/VSCode-Maxim/main/img/gpio_build.JPG)

... with our build products and final program binary output inside of a `build` folder.

![GPIO Build Products](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaximIntegratedTechSupport/VSCode-Maxim/main/img/gpio_build_products.JPG)

---

### 6 - Wrapping Up

From here, the example is ready to be flashed to the target microcontroller, debugged, edited, and explored further.  This same process can be applied to injecting the VS Code setup into any example project or existing source code.  

To summarize, you will...

1. Copy the contents of the `Inject` folder into the root directory of the existing project (optionally renaming any existing Makefile for later reference).
2. Open the root directory of the project folder from within VS Code
3. Configure `settings.json` to match your target platform
4. Configure the Build system with project.mk if needed.
5. Clean-periph and rebuild.

---

## Conclusion

Visual Studio Code is a great free code editor that, with the help of [VSCode-Maxim](https://github.com/MaximIntegratedTechSupport/VSCode-Maxim), can be used for embedded development with Maxim's Microcontroller toolchain.  Having worked through this User Guide, you now hopefully have a good understanding of how Maxim's toolchain works, how it's integrated into VS Code, and how to leverage it to develop your own projects.
